      The body needs food to survive. But consumption of food is not the sole reason for our being. Similarly, though profit maximisation is the most rudimentary objective of a business - essential to avert any potential threat to Going Concern - it is definitely not its only purpose.

      Businesses are the biggest contributors to employment across countries. If a company has 100 employees and if we assume each employee has a family of 4 members, then a single business is responsible for supporting 400 people. Not only do they employ the largest number of people, they also contribute to the formation and sustenance of a healthy economy. They act as major drivers  of the economy when they hire workers, raise salaries and invest in growing their business.

      Businesses work hand-in-hand with government on various pressing concerns like social infrastructure, promoting environmental protection and ensuring an overall betterment of underprivileged communities. They work towards social upliftment and environmental transformation, address healthcare and sanitation issues, ensure gender and social equality and more.

      A business does not only stand for itself. To illustrate, a company in the automobile industry gives rise to several other industries such as tyre industries, engineering industries, steel industries, petroleum industries and many more.

      In the present-day scenario it can no longer be said that profit-making is the sole motive of a business. Business are now playing a significant role in taking the economy to new heights. Modern times are witnessing a greater interdependence between business and society.` },

  Competition in the business-world is a good thing. It pushes businesses to strive to be the absolute best. Competition allows for stronger innovation, ensures consumers get quality products at lower prices and increases overall consumption in the economy. However, if management is not too careful, competition can also take an unhealthy form.

  Competition becomes unhealthy when it presupposes that there is only a limited amount of success or achievement available out there in the world. It stems from a place of insecurity and self-doubt – a means to get external attention and validation. Immoral and unethical competitors may resort to desperate measures to sabotage a rival company.

  Employee sabotage is the hidden scourge of many organisations. Employee saboteurs inflict damage to the property, reputation, product or service of an organisation. The reasons for it can be personal frustrations, a need to feel mastery over the environment or an opportunity to settle a difference with a manager or co-worker.

  If a company is weakened as a  result of the sabotage, the saboteur employee may end up losing his job. Even if the sabotage attempt results in some temporary gain to the saboteur, in never stays hidden in the long-run. There exists certain kinds of employees who provoke the saboteurs, push them towards the wrong path and then they themselves reveal everything to the employer to get in their good books. It has been seen in countless instances where management, being fully aware of the identity of the saboteur, feigns ignorance and lays elaborate traps to catch him/her red-handed. In the end, the saboteur employee ends up with nothing – forever blacklisted in the relevant industry. Some employers may forgive such errors but everyone may not be that kind.

  External sabotage cannot exist without internal abetment. A competitor can wage full-on war against a company but that won’t be ‘sabotage’, per se. Competitors with mal-intent may bribe, coax or coerce morally corrupt employees for  personal gains. Internal sabotage is a pre-requisite to external sabotage.

  Morally compromised employees may try to sabotage their employer but they never successfully get away with it. Their true face always comes to the light and they end up losing their reputation, their job, and even any chance of future employment.` },
    { id: 3, title: 'Employees are not resources', image: Employees , author: 'Arnab Sengupta', content :`Who is a human? It is someone who has the ability to make their own decisions and bear the consequences of the same. A human is someone who has the capacity to feel empathy. The phrase “human resource” treats people as a means to an end. The Versailles Treaty said that peace ‘can only be established if it is based upon Social Justice’ and social justice requires that people are ends in themselves, not means for other people’s ends.

  In a just society, human capacity expands through education, better health and sustainable prosperity. Human creativity is freed when people have a voice in important matters, security to plan their lives, and material resources to fulfil their potential. If humans are exploited like material resources, for the private gain of a few, this must diminish total social prosperity. Labour is not a commodity; humans are not a resource.

  Whenever the essential tenets of ‘human resource’ theory have been put into practice most fully, the outcomes for prosperity have been the worst.  In the last 40 years, developed societies have moved into a phase of lower productivity and growth, higher unemployment, and higher inequality. This all adds up to a lower rate of human development.

  The above-mentioned changes have not been a part of any conscious plans, but a state of mind. It is written in textbook titles and corridor signs, a part of daily terminology. A corrosive ideology: a human is a resource.

  Of course, it could be argued that language does not matter. Perhaps it is possible to use the term ‘human resource' in it’s original sense, to extol the boundless capacity of people to improve themselves and contribute to a better society. But words do matter. Words carry meaning.

  A major concern about treating people as assets or resources is that it results in them being commoditized and objectified. What an individual will become depends on what kind of environment the organisation can create. Therefore, human being is not a resource; a human being is a possibility.` },
    { id: 4, title: 'Significance Of Time', image: Significance, author: 'Arnab Sengupta', content :`‘Time’ means the progress of events, and also the way in which this progress of events is measured (using hours, days, years and so on).

  Importance of time-

  Time once past cannot be brought back by any means and it is important to understand the value of time. There goes a proverb, “Time and tide waits for none”.

  However some people do not realize the value of time and spend it unwisely. They should realize that many of the future troubles can be avoided by taking prompt action in a timely manner. The famous proverb “a stitch in time saves nine”, also highlights the importance of sorting out problem at early stage.

  Importance of Time-management for success:-

  Time – management always remains the critical success factor. If anybody wastes his childhood, he will not be able to acquire and build up character in future and will suffer all consequences. Similarly, if a student neglects his studies day –to- day, no amount of hard labour before the examination will get him through. Time – management is a good habit and lays the foundation of a success in future.

  Punctuality-

  A person who understands the value of time practices punctuality in life. If we look around we will see that the successful people in all spheres of life made proper use of every moment of their time. The most prosperous nations too are those that do not waste any moment.

  Courtesy-

  Being on time and being aware of time ensures that we will not turn up late for our appointments. This is very important if we want to treat other people with politeness and respect. Their time is valuable, just like ours is and we should not cause them to waste it.

  Future is unseen-

  Though the future is unseen, man can work hard to increase the probability of a better future. We should try our best to avoid the habit of indolence and begin to do our jobs in time. It will surely brighten our future.

  To conclude, it is foolishness to think that we can make up for the lost time. There is a popular saying that “ the past is dead and future is unborn.” There are no tomorrows and yesterdays. It is ‘today’ which is important. All great men are the great economizers of time. They have their footprints on the sands of time… we should follow and learn to make the best use of time.` },
    { id: 5, title: 'Education Without Philosophy Is Futile', image: Education , author: 'Arnab Sengupta', content :`Education and philosophy are closely inter-related. Philosophy is love of knowledge and education is acquisition of knowledge. Philosophy is the corner stone of the foundation of education. Education is practical activity of philosophical thought. Without philosophy, education would be a blind effort and without education, philosophy would be crippled. Philosophy answers thousands of questions pertaining to the whole field of education.

  Aims and Objectives:-

  Education in every society is directed for specific aims and objectives. That aims and objectives are set by a philosophical approach. For example, the aims of an education system are to develop socially and morally sound person.

  Methods and Curriculum:-

  Every educational system is based upon specific teaching methodologies and the curriculum. What should be the teaching methodology? And what kind of teacher should be? And what kind of curriculum be taught to the students? All the answers are given by philosophy.

  Philosophy of Education:-

  There is a separate branch of philosophy which is called Philosophy Of Education. The branch investigates that what should be the nature of education? Whether the education aims be based on specific religion, social, moral, scientific bases. And how these aims can be achieved?

  Education – the dynamic side of philosophy:-

  Education is the dynamic side of philosophy. It is the active aspect and the practical means of realising the ideals of life. Education is a sacred necessity of life, both from the biological and sociological point of view.

  The choice of students must cater to the principles and purposes of philosophy. Choice of curriculum needs philosophers or leaders of thought. With the change of time and circumstances, the curricula also changes and this change can be brought out by philosophers alone.

  Education is a laboratory where philosophic theories and speculations are tested and made concrete. Education may, therefore, be rightly called applied philosophy.

  A student must have a proper moral character then only he or she can accomplish the dreams not only by mere degree.

  Raymont argues: philosophy is an unceasing? To discover the general truth that lies behind the particular facts, to discern also that lies behind appearances.

  So, education will not have any value without philosophy.` },

Education is immensely important for every individual for proper burgeoning. Words of Swami Vivekananda in this context are pertinent indeed. He said, “Education is the manifestation of knowledge already within”. He compared a child with a plant. To grow up properly a plant requires suitable atmosphere alike a child. For most of the children are bereft of the desired suitable environment. As a corollary, their growing is not impeded but hardly reached the coveted level and desire of the individuals remains unfulfilled.

  In modern world of education traditional study at the universities and colleges is gradually complemented or even replaced by new technologies of distance learning. This type of education has gained its growing popularity with the developing of internet, as students can simply communicate with their teachers and exchange materials over the net, even living in the different parts of the world.

  Geographic Flexibility:-

  Distance learning can increase opportunities for students across the globe, ensuring that students don’t have to choose an institution based solely on its location.

  Decreased Cost:-

  For students who can afford a traditional college education or who struggle to afford transportation cost, distance education can be a powerful game changer.

  Time Flexibility:-

  Distance- based learning offers more flexibility to students in terms of how and when they take classes. Many distance- based courses allow students to use several different learning modules, such as online message boards, chat room, video-conferences and recordings of lectures, making distance learning a highly customizable education option.

  Student Diversity:-

  Not all students thrive in a traditional lecture setting, and some students may even be made anxions by large groups. Distance learning enables students from many walks of life to attend school. For students with physical disabilities, distance learning means they can avoid navigating a challenging college campus.` },

  Researchers have examined building information modeling (BIM), or parametric three- dimensional computer-aided design, from a myriad of technological perspectives. Many of these studies focus on examining or enhancing the interoperability of building information modeling technologies across project networks. The findings highlight the importance of understanding and developing inter organizational work practices to reap the benefits of building information modeling. The realization of the increased functionality and productivity associated with BIM tools requires firms to successfully adopt and implement the associated technologies.

  Changes made in building projects during their design and executions are a major cause for delays, cost overruns and deviations from performance requirements. The impact of changes on the project often becomes clear only after their implementation in the project. At that stage it is difficult to make adjustments or consider alternatives. A timely recognition, by the project team, of the implications of proposed changes can lead to a reconsideration of the changes, so that the completed project would still meet the client’s objectives.

  Different model based tools are used now-a-days in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry. The model facilitates an automatic identification of the possible consequences  of changes  when they are first proposed,  prior to their implementation  in the design and planning of the project. The model utilizes available sources of project information in order to identify the impact of changes on the primary client objectives of cost, schedule and performance. The users, using different model based tools, continue to differentiate themselves from those who have yet to adopt the technology, bringing value to clients while improving their bottom line.

  As  we  face  uncertain  economic  times  in  2009,  and  perhaps  beyond,  innovative approaches to project delivery, such as BIM can be critically important differentiators among service firms and can help owners more effectively to control costs, quality and completion schedules.

  Introduction

  Building  information modeling (BIM) is a new industry term referring  to parametric three-dimensional (3D)  computer-aided design (CAD)  technologies and  processes  in  the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry. BIM models represent the spatial relationships  between  building components  and contain  logic  that facilitates information extraction from  the  model (for  example,  sets  of plans  or material  quantity  takeoffs).  BIM technologies are unique when compared to earlier advances in CAD technology because when coupled with  integration  of work  practices  among  architects, engineers, fabricators,  and contractors  they can  lead  to  tremendous  improvements  in project  productivity. With  two- dimensional line-based CAD, data were typically exchanged between firms in the form of a printed set  of plans. The plans  themselves  then  became the  visual representation  where coordination and conflicts could be elaborated and resolved (Henderson 1999). However, with BIM a network of interdependent architects, engineers, fabricators, and construction firms can collaborate to develop a virtual building information model of the planned structure (Taylor 2007). A more thorough understanding of how BIM paradigms evolve in project networks will enable architects, engineers, fabricators, and contractors to both anticipate and accelerate the capture of benefits associated with BIM tools and processes.

  Background

  One theory claims that Professor Charles M. Eastman at Georgia Institute of Technology coined the term. This theory is based on a view that the term Building Information Model is basically the same as Building Product Model, which Professor Eastman has used extensively in his book and papers since the late 1970s. (‘Product model’ means ‘data model’ or ‘information model’ in engineering.)

  Nevertheless, it is agreed upon that the term was popularized by Jerry Laiserin as a common name for a digital representation of the building process to facilitate exchange and interoperability of information in digital format.

  Researchers contend that building information modeling technologies are being adopted more slowly in the AEC industry than its predecessor two-dimensional (2D) CAD (Whyte et al.1999,  2002).  Harty  (2005)  identified  how  the  implementation   of  3D  CAD  in  a  large infrastructure project had spillover effects that impacted multiple firms. He termed innovations like 3D CAD that impact multiple firms as “unbounded” innovations (Harty 2005, p. 512). Elsewhere researchers classify innovations that impact multiple specialist organizations as “systemic” innovations (Taylor and Levitt 2004, p. 84). Research has shown how systemic innovations are more difficult to implement and diffuse more slowly than localized innovations (Taylor 2007; Taylor and Levitt 2007). In addition to research on adoption and implementation of 3D CAD, a number of researchers explore the development of objects and tools to support cooperative model-based design and construction (Roy and Kodkani 1999; Szykman et al. 2001; Halfawy and Froese 2005). Some of these researchers seek to address general issues of CAD object interoperability (Szykman et al. 2001) while others explore Web-based forms of object exchange (Roy and Kodkani 1999) or idiosyncratic object extensions to capture the AEC design process (Halfawy and Froese 2005). A recent report by the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the United States (Gallaher et al. 2004) estimates the cost of inadequate interoperability in the AEC industry to be $15.8 billion. As a result, the body of literature on interoperability  of model-based  design  software  will  likely  continue  to  grow  and  evolve  to address this global issue. Researchers who focused on improving interoperability of model-based CAD tools are joined by a growing body of researchers seeking to use these tools to integrate processes not feasible with 2D CAD. Researchers explore the use of BIM tools to integrate and improve the scheduling of construction activities (Songer et al. 2001; Heesom and Mahdjoubi 2004),  the  estimation  of  costs  (Staub-French  et  al.  2003),  the  constructability  of  buildings (Fischer 1993), the identification of time-space conflicts in production (Akinci et al. 2002), and the visualization of the construction process (McKinney and Fischer 1998). The realization of the increased functionality and productivity associated with BIM tools requires firms to successfully adopt and implement the associated technologies. However, it has been shown that design and construction firms are adopting BIM tools slowly when compared to earlier adoption of 2D CAD (Whyte et al. 2002; 1999). Users of these tools operate in interdependent project networks (Chinowsky and Taylor 2007). Research has show that BIM tools impact interdependent work processes in project networks (Harty 2005; Taylor 2007). To capture the full benefit of BIM tools, firms in project networks must coordinate and develop interoperable business practices. However, firms may have different interpretations—or paradigms—toward the practice of using BIM tools. Technological paradigms have been shown to exist and vary among firms in a population (Dosi 1982). Differences in paradigmatic practice across organizations in a project network increase difficulties in developing inter organizational practices to support efficient use of  BIM  tools.  This  may  explain  difficulties  identified  in  the  adoption  of  BIM  tools  when compared to earlier 2D CAD adoption rates.

  Market Summary
  Competitive Advantage of BIM in a Down Economy

  McGraw-Hill Construction research shows that, in the face of an economic recession, BIM users expect to significantly ramp up their investment in BIM in 2009. Experienced users are  realizing  greater  productivity,  improved  communications  and  a  competitive  edge  when bidding work. As development opportunities tighten, these users continue to differentiate themselves from those who have yet to adopt the technology, bringing value to clients while improving their bottom line.

  Key Findings

  62% of BIM users will use it on more than 30% of their projects in 2009.
  82% of BIM experts believe that BIM has a very positive impact on their company’s productivity.
  72% of BIM users say that BIM has had an impact on their internal project processes.
  Market Adoption and Growth

  BIM is being broadly adopted across the construction industry with over 50% of each survey segment – architect, engineers, contractors, and owners (AEC/O) – utilizing the tools at moderate levels or higher. In the population as a whole, roughly one-third (35%) of BIM users are very heavy users, one-third (27%) are medium to heavy users, and one-third (38%) are light users.

  Key segment findings include:

  Architects are the heaviest users of BIM with 43% using it on more than 60% of their projects.
  Contractors are the lightest users of BIM with nearly half (45%) using it on less than 15% of projects and a quarter (23%) using it on more than 60% of projects.
  BIM usage will also grow rapidly in the coming year. Nearly half  of  all  current  adopters  (45%) will be heavy users of BIM in 2009, using it on at least 60% of their projects—a  10 point increase  over the previous year.

  A majority of architects (54%) will be very heavy users of BIM in 2009, up from 43% in 2008.
  Contractors expect to see the greatest increase in BIM usage in 2009. Thirty eight percent will be heavy users, up from 23% in 2009. Only 12% expect light use of BIM, compared to 45% the previous year.
  Groth Of BIM

  User Experience

  The rising use of BIM correlates with a generally upbeat assessment of its impact on users’ business practices. As users begin to see its benefits, they deepen their involvement with BIM.

  Half of users say BIM has a very positive impact on their respective companies. Only 7% report a negative impact.
  As users gain experience with BIM, their view of its impact improves significantly.
  Contractors (61%) have the most positive view of BIM.
  Most architects see BIM as having a very positive impact on their businesses.
  Owners are beginning to see the value of BIM, with 41% reporting that BIM has a positive impact on their projects. One-third are very willing to purchase BIM software for other team members and half are at least moderately willing to pay extra for time and effort on detailing BIM models.
  BIM Adoption

  Measuring the Value of BIM

  Survey results indicate that 48% of respondents are tracking BIM return on investment (ROI) at a moderate level or above. Results from companies who are actively tracking BIM return on investment (ROI) (see PCL Construction Case Study and Holder Construction interview) are showing initial BIM ROIs of 300 to 500% on projects where BIM was used.

  A follow up McGraw-Hill Construction online survey of AGC BIM Forum members (November 2008) found that the average perception of ROI on BIM to be between11% and 30%. However, those making the effort to measure ROI perceive a higher value. Among those that do measure it, almost one third report an ROI greater than 100%, with several greater than 1,000%. Thus measuring ROI establishes greater benefit of BIM than mere intuition suggests.

  Some of the most important aspects of BIM ROI being measured by firms include:

  Improved project outcomes such as fewer RFIs and field coordination problems (79%)
  Better communication because of 3D visualization (79%)
  Positive impact on winning projects (66%)
  Measuring ROI

  Internal and External Impact of BIM

  BIM is changing the way companies work internally as well as with external team members. In order to reap the greatest benefit from BIM, many users recognize a need to rethink roles and work flow. As a repository of information from multiple team members, BIM also promotes a more collaborative environment that breaks down traditional boundaries between firms and allows the sharing of project data among users.

  Seven in 10 users say that BIM has had at least a moderate impact on their internal project practices.
  Two-thirds of users say that BIM has had at least a moderate impact on their external project processes.
  Top Ways BIM Changes How Users Work

  Routinely using BIM’s 3D visualization capabilities to communicate with all parties.
  Using BIM on the jobsite to guide construction activities.
  More time designing, less time documenting.
  Adoption of BIM

  Building information modeling is quickly gaining traction. After years  of  development and experimentation in the marketplace, BIM is bringing swift transformative change to how its users approach their work. Research shows  that  users  see clear   benefits   of   BIM and they are responding by  deepening  their  use of the technology. At a time when the overall development market is tightening,   these   users are looking for BIM to help them gain a competitive advantage.

  The expanding use of BIM is profound. All users expect to rapidly increase  their  use  of BIM in 2009. In 2008, one-third of BIM users said    they    were   very heavy users, involving it in at least three in five of their current projects. Next year, nearly half expect to use BIM at that level—a 10 point increase over the previous year.

  Growth of BIM

  User Differences

  Contractors could see the greatest rise in use. Although contractors report relatively limited BIM use compared to others, they are quickly catching up. Twenty-three percent currently use BIM on 60% or more of projects. Thirty-eight percent expect to use it at that level in 2009—a 15 point increase.
  Architects use BIM on the highest percentage of projects. Because many architects were among the early adopters of BIM, they have a head start on other users. A majority of architects expect to become very heavy users of BIM next year, jumping from 43% in 2008 to 54% in 2009. This substantial commitment to BIM could prompt other team members to increase their use of the technology as well.
  Engineers  see  their  BIM  use  increasing,  but  not  as  drastically  as  other  build  team members. Thirty five percent use BIM on at least 60% of their current projects. Forty- three percent expect to use it at that level next year.
  Owners  expect  to  see  moderate  increases  compared  to  other  build  team  members. Owners currently have limited opportunities to use BIM for operations and maintenance purposes. As those capabilities develop, BIM use among owners could increase significantly.
  Perception of BIM

  As  BIM  use  becomes  more  relevant, much of the industry has a positive view of its effect on their business practices. Half   of  users   say   BIM   has   a  very positive impact on their respective companies. Only one in ten experience a negative impact. Users offer an upbeat assessment of BIM despite the fact that a limited  number  of  users  measure  their ROI  (see  section  “Value  of  Using BIM”). This suggests that although many users can’t quantify its benefits, they still embrace BIM’s promise.

  Contractors have the most positive view of BIM. Sixty-one percent of contractors say it has a very positive effect on their companies. Contractors see benefits such as improved clash detection that can directly reduce costs and delays.

  Architects also see BIM as beneficial with three in five reporting it has a very positive effect. Thirty eight percent say it has a neutral or slightly positive impact. Through  use  of  BIM,  many  architects find  they  can  spend  less  time  drafting and more time designing.

  BIM ad

  Engineers are also generally positive about BIM, though slightly less compared to other users. Thirty seven percent report that BIM has a very positive effect on their businesses. A majority (54%) say BIM has a neutral or slightly positive effect. Engineers can leverage data in BIM to help with simulation and analysis.

  Owners are largely positive about BIM, but less than contractors and architects. One in 10 reports that it has a negative impact. This could be related to concerns over its cost. Many owners do not see the direct benefits of BIM compared to others. This could change as the capabilities of BIM for owners expand.

  BIM Impact

  Usage of BIM

  The great promise of BIM is its expansive range of  applications  for  users. At its basic level, BIM represents an evolution from traditional 2D design to a dynamic 3D model built around a database of a project’s physical and functional characteristics. The more data users add to the model, the more benefits can be leveraged from it. Beyond 3D visualization of a project, information about specific objects within the model can be used for a wide range of analyses such as building performance, schedule and costs. Today, 3D modeling is by far the most popular use of BIM, with architects leading the way.

  BIM in projects

  Other users, such as engineers, are finding selective ways to model elements in BIM. Contractors are building momentum for the use of BIM in 4D (scheduling) and 5D (cost estimating). As users continue to gain expertise with BIM, they will further capitalize on the technology’s potential and push for new ways to garner benefits in areas such as sustainability and building operations. Architects and engineers will likely use BIM to do energy analyses, and owners will use the BIM model to manage and maintain their facilities.

  Modeled Elements on BIM Projects

  Build team members say that architectural, structural, mechanical and plumbing  elements—in  that  order—are  the most likely to be modeled when using BIM. This view holds generally true among all team members, although the larger and more experienced the firm is, the more likely it is to see these elements modeled on BIM projects. This view makes sense in light of the BIM adoption and usage patterns of various disciplines.Architects lead the way with 54% reporting to be either heavy or very heavy users in 2008. Engineers lag slightly as 43% of all engineering disciplines combined are at that usage level. In 2009, fully two-thirds of architects predict being either heavy or very heavy users—a 41% increase. By comparison, engineers predict a 37% increase at this usage level in 2009.

  Elements with BIM

  Electrical engineers lag behind mechanical and structural. This is likely due in part to the relative lack of content for electrical elements. These elements also have smaller physical size requirements in buildings compared to bulky structural systems, large mechanical elements like duct work, and the diameter and pitch/location requirements of plumbing waste lines. As such, electrical coordination issues are less challenging and modeling is less critical.

  Users suggest a relative prominence of accessibility planning as a special function (30%). This points the way toward more innovative uses of BIM modeling beyond visualization and powerful efficiencies by using simulation to optimize logistics, phasing, equipment locations and materials handling. As more enabling applications come online that extract relevant data from design models to automate valuable tasks, it is likely that their use will dramatically increase.

  Paradigm change to BIM:
  For each of the three major phases in the building lifecycle—

  Design, Construction and Management, Building Information Modeling offers access to the following critical information:

  In the design phase—Design, Schedule and Budget information
  In the construction phase—Quality, Schedule and Cost Information
  In the management phase—Performance, Utilization and Financial Information
  Vtt

  BIM according to American Institute of Architects as “a model-based technology linked

  with a database of project information”.
  Database systems provide various facilities including modeling data, queries, semantic integrity control, concurrency control, recovery and authorization. The transition from relational database technology to object technology is characterized by a richer data model to meet the requirements of new applications. The building practice, for example, is characterized by the organization of different participants that work towards the elaboration of the building; each one performs a specific role and has a specific view on the building project data.

  Tekla ‐ BIM:

  Tekla Structures software is a BIM (building information modeling) tool that streamlines the delivery process of design, detailing, manufacture, and construction organizations. While integrating openly with architectural models, the strength of this single-model environment lies in the contractor end of the process. Thousands of Tekla Structures software users in more than 80 countries have successfully delivered BIM-based projects across the world. Tekla Structures’ ability to process extensive amounts of data enables the creation of detailed 3D models that apply to every stage of design and construction. From planning and design development thru to fabrication and installation, Tekla models naturally develop in parallel, representing  the “as- built” condition of a building. Tekla Structures effectively integrates into any best-of-breed software driven workflow, while maintaining the highest levels of data integrity and accuracy.

  Detailing & Fabrication

  Such  collaborative  workflows  are  the  cornerstone to  minimizing  errors and  maximizing efficiency, resulting in high profitability and on-time project completion. Tekla Structures encompasses specialized configurations for structural engineers, steel detailers and fabricators, precast concrete detailers and manufacturers, as well as contractors.

  “There is enough cultural and social awareness about BIM that it will eventually become part of our daily work process. Tekla has been BIM even before the name was created. And with its sound position in the automation back‐end of the construction process, Tekla is on the leading edge of innovation.” – Professor Charles M. Eastman, Director, Ph D Program for the College of Architecture at Georgia Tech, US

  Tekla takes the architectural model from architectural BIM solutions (and other reference models from other solutions) and makes them into a constructable model.

  Structural BIM

  Tekla  offers  the  highest  level  of  constructability   on  project  delivery  (Design  BIM  vs Construction  BIM).  The  model  is  easy  to  change  and  coordinate  changes  between  several designers who do different tasks in the model. Tekla technology enables the creation and management of accurately detailed, highly constructable building information models that act as the new center of optimized building production.

  To ease the job of fabricators, different software are used for material management. Information can easily be transferred from one software system to other software, which reduce the effort of the fabricators. Combination of BIM software tools (specially Tekla steel detailing) and steel fabrication material management software (Fabtrol), it is very easy to transfer data for fabricator use within a justified time and with great accuracy. Any steel detailing service provider companies can easily increase the revenue by using these kind of software.

  Fabtrol Systems:

  Leading solution for steel fabrication materials management
  Fully integrated, modular software solution for managing estimating, drawings, materials, production, and shipping
  Estimating-Drawing-Materials

  Preparing accurate takeoffs requires a tremendous amount of knowledge – material availability,  labor  rates,  and waste  factors.  Finding  people  with  the right skills is not easy. FabTrol MRP offers an alternative. By translating the knowledge of senior estimators into company-standard  data  tables,  it limits  the  expertise  required  to prepare  takeoffs.  Even  the greenest apprentice can be trained to work up reliable bids. And the senior staff can focus on making the final adjustments that will ensure winning, profitable bottom lines.

  Drawings are the lifeblood of the fabrication process, but managing their revisions and approvals can be a real nuisance. Without an integrated solution, many steel fabricators settle for keeping a simple drawing log by hand. Such systems are a pain to maintain, but that’s nothing next to the risk of issuing the wrong drawing to the shop because someone lost track of the revisions.

  FabTrol MRP software offers a better solution. Its powerful links with the industry’s leading  detailing  software  solutions  enables  fast,  error-free  data  transfers.  And  beyond  a simplistic  one-line-per-drawing  log,  it  provides  a  true  management  system  and  up-to-date statusing mechanism for drawings and revisions.

  With FabTrol MRP, you can import bills of materials, drawing image files, and in some cases even CNC instructions from nearly any detailing software, including:

  SDS/2®, Tekla Structures (Xsteel®), StruCAD®, AutoCAD® and its add-ons, Any KISS- compliant  system,  including  3D+®,  FASTRAK®,  CadVantage  CVSpro®,  SteelCad®,  and more.

  In  a  material-intensive  business  like  steel  fabrication,  better  usage  and  handling  of materials can have a major impact on your bottom line. FabTrol MRP software tackles the challenge of material management with the best weapons of modern technology: automation and integration.

  Companies need a powerful integrated production management system, which includes: CAD & CNC integration, Shop capacity planning, Automated routing to work areas, Estimated fabrication times, Work order & cut list management, Progress tracking etc. These all facilities are included in FabTrol MRP software.

  It allows user to easily plan sensible, right-sized loads, manage them through the shop, and track their status throughout the process.

  Conclusion

  As recognition of the benefits of BIM grows, the ability of design professionals, contractors,  fabricators  and  suppliers  to  work  effectively  in  this  new  environment  will increasingly  become  a  competitive  differentiator  in winning  work.  In challenging  economic times this kind of edge can be critically important to survival. Also, owners competing for scarce capital  resources  will  find  an  advantage  in  being  able  to  demonstrate  the  ability  to  more accurately control costs, quality and schedule through implementation of BIM.

  Previous research on BIM or parametric 3D CAD has focused largely on issues of technological interoperability. A report by the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the  United  States  described  inadequate  interoperability  of  technology  in  the  design  and construction industry in the United States alone as a $15.8 billion problem annually (Gallaher et al. 2004). Therefore research focused on improving BIM technological interoperability will certainly  continue  to  increase.  Addressing  technological  interoperability  is  not  sufficient  to unleash the benefits of integrated technologies. When technological change spans inter organizational boundaries in project networks, inter organizational business practices must also evolve and adapt to these changes. Future research should examine how differences in BIM practice paradigms impact project performance. It should consider the impact of other potentially causal factors on BIM paradigm evolution such as project complexity, project size, and specific BIM tool used to develop a more nuanced explanation of how firm practice paradigms evolve. The existence of some firms who view BIM as a way to enhance visualization, others that see BIM as playing an important coordination role, others who view BIM principally as an analytical tool, and finally others who view BIM chiefly as a means to integrate product information into the supply chain, is likely to limit the benefits of using BIM for all firms in the project network. Research should identify ways to improve coordination given the existence of this array of paradigms that can coexist on a project. A promising avenue for future research would be to examine whether firms choosing partners in interdependent project activities based on their stage of practice paradigmatic evolution impacts firm-level and project-level performance.

  Contractors are predicting an acceleration of BIM usage that significantly outstrips the other groups surveyed, and paves the way for 2009 to be “the year of the contractor” in BIM. Most contractors using BIM are not waiting to receive BIM files from designers but are doing 2D-to-BIM conversion from whatever CAD files or paper documents they can get their hands on. The tangibility of the benefits that contractors can extract from BIM makes a compelling business case for investing. This trend mirrors the traditional lifecycle progression of a project, where the architect is initially responsible for the format of information and shares it judiciously with a small group of consultant Then contractors assume responsibility, using their own tools and processes to interpret, divide and distribute that information broadly for multiple purposes through to completion. BIM has now evolved from a focused tool set for design to a more comprehensive platform for design and construction integration, driving major changes in the ways all the players interact.` },

  Different models based tool are used now-a-days in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry. The model facilitates an automatic identification of the possible consequences of changes when they are first proposed, prior to their implementation in the design and planning of the project. The model utilizes available sources of project information in order to identify the impact of changes on the primary client objectives of cost, schedule and performance. The users, using different model based tools, continue to differentiate themselves from those who have yet to adopt the technology, bringing value to clients while improving their bottom line.



  In typical projects, the prime contractor takes responsibility for procuring the steel, arranging for fabrication, and ultimately building the structure. The contractor first selects the shop drawing detailer and the steel fabricator. The detailer develops preliminary shop drawings, used for ordering steel from the mill for delivery to the fabricator. Thus the prime contractor assumes the risk for availability and delivery of steel to meet the contract schedule. This highly linear process can add six to eight weeks to the project schedule for a complex structure.
  No matter the geographic location, skilled shop labor is rapidly declining, and shop managers need a definite plan to strengthen the future of the structural fabrication industry.



  What is the Solution?
  We can never replace the human factor in business success, but automating the more mundane tasks may provide the solution for many of the labor problems. By using automation to its best advantage, shops will be able to eliminate the simpler tasks, reducing their dependence on newer, untrained employees and allowing more time for training and more specialized tasks. Automation using the technology of today promises a hopeful future for steel fabricators around the world.

  Problem-solving through Automation and Labor & Material saving

  Technology

  Fortunately, many equipment manufacturers and software vendors have already begun to take advantage of technology in order to provide solutions to the structural industry’s problems:

  Problem: Beam transport using slow-moving overhead bridge cranes has proven to be ineffective and occasionally hazardous.

  Solution: Today’s systematic beam processing.

  Progressive fabrication shops employ knowledgeable firms to design shop layouts where materials are handled effectively and efficiently.

  All stock sections are loaded in the materials yard to save shop space for more sophisticated fabrication (i.e., trusses), which can increase profit over time.

  Systematic beam processing is designed to maximize tonnage production while minimizing inventory costs for just-in-time fabrication.

  Cross-transfer systems effectively transport long sections from one bay to another in seconds, nullifying traditional beam-handling methods.

  Problem: Manually produced production drawings take time to create and are difficult to apply to physical production.

  Solution: Today’s building information modeling (BIM), like Tekla Structures and material requirements planning (MRP) software, like FabTrol MRP, the global leader in steel fabrication management software.

  Users can create building models that provide data that’s immediately useful at any stage of the building process.

  Data taken from the model can be transferred directly to computer numerical control (CNC) machine tools on the shop floor, minimizing the chance for operator error; thus each fabricated member fits together with unerring precision.

  MRP software monitors project flow through the shop, from unloading the stock material to loading finished fabricated parts onto trucks for transport.

  Problem: Creating detail components using burn tables and other machines requires multiple operators, exposes workers to unnecessary “table-top” hazards, and takes up too much space.

  Solution: Today’s machine designs for producing plate and angle detail connections.

  These machines incorporate multiple technologies such as high-speed drilling, punching, carbide part-making, and high definition plasma and oxy-fuel cutting.

  Stock material is handled one piece at a time—faster and much safer than in the past.

  Modern machines eliminate the need for multiple laborers, requiring only one operator to monitor all loading, processing, and unloading functions.

  Accommodating Shop Labor, New and Old

  Even with all of these advances, the human element in the fabrication process is no less present or important. Since a successful fab shop will always be dependent on labor, and must evolve along with incoming workers to meet their needs and increase their productivity, innovators have focused on the smaller elements of the job as well. These innovations will eliminate hazards and inconveniences in the workplace, granting new laborers time to learn crucial details of the job from their coworkers:

  Problem: Saw flood coolant is hazardous and takes too much time and labor to clean up and contain.

  Solution: New band saw coolant technology is now on the market, and new band saws no longer require flood-type lubricant to lubricate the blade and remove chips during the sawing process.

  In the past:

  The coolant had to be mixed with water.

  Bacteria thrived in the old coolant medium, causing skin problems for workers and creating a foul-smelling workplace.

  Material was doused with coolant, which left a residue that had to be cleaned before the material could be painted.

  Old coolant had to be removed by professional cleanup firms, adding one more shop expense.

  Today:

  Technologically advanced machines, using vegetablebased micro-mist coolant, are now available.

  The coolant can be directly added to the machine—no mixing required.

  The coolant system’s configuration inhibits the introduction and growth of bacteria.

  The micro-mist is applied in a fine spray directly onto the cutting site, and never in excess. D As the mist is applied directly and sparingly to the blade tooth area, disposal is no longer a concern.

  Problem: New laborers lack the knowledge and experience to operate and maintain sophisticated machinery.

  Solution: New machine controls are outfitted with today’s electronic technology.

  Today’s CNC controls with PC front ends provide a back-up system of operation; if one system should fail, the other system keeps the machine functioning.

  With remote diagnostic programs, machines anywhere on the planet can be accessed by qualified service technicians via the Internet. Corrections can be made quickly and easily.

  Problem: A lack of support for machinery and equipment.

  Solution: An increase in technical service assistance to meet the needs of growing companies. D Using effective communication centers equipped with the latest technology, long-distance technical service is more available than ever, giving fab shops the opportunity to utilize the experience of seasoned service professionals.D Skilled technicians can travel more easily than ever before, providing prompt and effective solutions to a variety of issues.

  Changes made in building projects during their design and executions are a major cause for delays, cost overruns and deviations from performance requirements. The impact of changes on the project often becomes clear only after their implementation in the project. At that stage it is difficult to make adjustments or consider alternatives. A timely recognition, by the project team, of the implications of proposed changes can lead to a reconsideration of the changes, so that the completed project would still meet the client’s objectives.

  Paradigm change to BIM:

  For each of the three major phases in the building lifecycle—

  Design, Construction and Management, Building Information Modeling offers access to the following critical information:

  In the design phase—Design, Schedule and Budget information
  In the construction phase—Quality, Schedule and Cost Information
  In the management phase—Performance, Utilization and Financial Information
  Tekla – BIM:

  Looking to the Future

  The construction world, including the structural steel fabrication industry, has reached a crucial point, one at which technological advancements provide the greatest hope for survival and continued growth. As society becomes more technologically advanced (not to mention dependent), the fabrication shops of the future must adapt to this changing shop environment; if they continue to cling to outdated methods, they run the risk of becoming obsolete.

  As evidenced by the NASCC exhibit floor, innovative firms are dedicating substantial engineering research and design investment dollars to provide advanced machine tool solutions that  address  these  labor  issues.  The  “fab  shop  of  the  future,”  using  today’s  advanced technologies, will soon be the standard by which the next generation of structural fabricators will operate.` },
