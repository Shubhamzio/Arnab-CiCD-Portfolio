  <h3>Chapter 12: The Law of Receptivity</h3>
  <p>Giving and receiving are two sides of the same coin. The secret to success is giving and giving cannot take place without receiving. The fifth and final law - The Law of Receptivity - says that every time you give something, you also have to be open to receive something back in return. Belief systems across the world have their own
versions of this law, like karma, Yin and Yang, etc. To every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Sometimes, we close ourselves off by disregarding the importance or thinking ourselves undeserving of receiving. Success willcome to us when we open up by allowing ourselves to dream big.</p>

  <h3>Chapter 13: Full Circle; Chapter 14: The Go-Giver</h3>
  <p>The book ends with the impactful message that the important thing in life is not what you achieve, but who you essentially are.We see Joe, co-founder of his own business, finally achieving what he always dreamed of.
The Go-Giver teaches us principles that can be applied by people of all age-groups and walks of life. The most important principle in life is to serve others. The key take-away of this book is to not run after money or focus only on your own success. Instead, focus on others and how much value you can give to them. If one prioritises
serving as many people as possible and wanting the best for them, then the people, in return, will also have our best interests at heart. If you provide great value, money and success will follow on their own.
