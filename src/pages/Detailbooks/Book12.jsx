   <h1>Lesson 1: Glean insights from your business colleagues by listening and paying close attention
</h1>
    <p> When first starting up a business it's very easy to be quickly consumed at the onset by numbers and growth. It can become obsessive. But it's really more about people, isn't it?
To get ahead in any business venture, whether that business is selling a product or hiring a working staff, the key is to identify who it is that you're doing business with. It's a good idea to take some time and figure out what it is that makes them tick. What is it that drives the people that you're dealing with? What are their motivations,
aspirations, and fears
Know their personalities and you can better predict their behaviour. For example, the slick businessman type,won't display that persona to everyone. He'll have several fa√ßades in his toolbo s boss, clients, employees, and family, all in different ways
If you can be aware of these multiple fronts, you will know that there is much more to this slick veneer than meets the eye. There's always a lot more going on beneath the surface. But to discover the depths of someone's personality,you really need to listen closely.

It's not uncommon at this point as you're about to clinch the deal, that you get the feeling that something is a bit off. You can't quite put your finger on
it, but something just isn't sitting well with you.
So what is your response to these feelings? Do you ignore them and continue, or do you hold the horses and rethink it?
Some discomfort is a perfectly understandable response and learning to trust these feelings is something that can be beneficial in business practices. It's okay to feel uneasy and apply the brakes, particularly when there is a large amount of money or something valuable at stake.
