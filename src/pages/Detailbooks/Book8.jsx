   <h1>Chapter 1: Three Surprises About Change
</h1>
    <p> One study, people with the large buckets ate 53 percent more popcorn than people n size
There are three surprises about change:
1. What looks like a people problem is often a situation problem.
2. What looks like laziness is often exhaustion
3. What looks like resistance isis often oer a lack of clarity.
For anything to change, someone has to start acting differently.
To change someone's behavior, you've got to change that person's situation.
The brain has two independent systems at work at all times. First, there's the emotional side. It's the part of you that is instinctive, that feels pain and pleasure. Second, there's the rational side, also known as the reflective or conscious system. It's the part of you that deliberates and analyzes and looks into the future.
Jonathan Haidt, the author of The Happiness Hypothesis, says that our emotional side is an Elephant and our rational side is its Rider.
Changes often fail because the Rider simply can't keep the Elephant on the road long enough to reach the destination.
If you want to change things, you've got to appeal to both Th and The Elephant. The former provides the planning and direction, and the latter provides the energy.
When Rider and Elephant disagree about which way to move got a problem.
The authors on why change is hard:
When people try to change things, they're usually tinkering with behaviors that have become automatic, and changing those behaviors requires careful supervision by the Rider. The bigger the change you're suggesting, the more it will sap people's self-control. And when people exhaust their self-control
mental muscles needed to think creatively, to focus, to inhibit their impulses, and to persist in the face of frustration or failure. In other words, they're exhausting precisely the mental muscles needed to make a big change.

The basic three-part framework you need to change behavior:
Direct the Rider.What looks like resistance is often a lack of clarity. So provide crystal-clear direction.
2. Motivate the Elephant. What looks like laziness is often exhaustion. The Rider can't get his way by force for very long. So it's critical that you engage people's emotional side-get their Elephants on the path and cooperative.
3. Shape the Path. What looks like apeople problem is oftenasituation problem. The authors call the situation (including the surrounding environment) the "Path." When you shape the Path, you make change more likely, no matter what's happening with the Rider and Elephant.
If you can do all three at once, dramatic change can happen even if you don't have lots of power or resources behind you.

  <h1>Chapter 2: Find the Bright Spots.</h1>
<p> Bright spots are successful efforts worth emulating.
In tough times, the Rider sees problems everywhere, and "analysis paralysis" often kicks in. The Rider will spin his wheels indefinitely unless he's given clear direction. That's why to make progress on a change, you need ways to direct the Rider. Show him where to go, how to act, what destination to pursue.
what they're exhausting are the
The Miracle Question: "Suppose that you go to bed tonight and sleep well. Sometime, in the middle of the night, while you are sleeping, a miracle happens and all the troubles that brought you here are resolved. When you wake up in the morning, what's the first small sign you'd see that would make you think, 'Well, something must have happened-the problem is gone.
The Exception Question: "When was the last time you saw a little bit of the miracle, even just for a short time?"
To find bright spots, ask yourself, "What's working and how can we do more of it?"
Big problems are rarely solved with commensurately big solutions. Instead, they are most often solved by a sequence of smallsolutions, sometimes over weeks, sometimes over decades.
In one exhaustive study, a psychologist analyzed 558 emotion words-every one that he could find in the English language - and found that 62 percent of them were negative versus 38 percent positive.

  <h3>Chapter 3: Script the Critical Moves</h3>
  <p>Decisions are the Rider's turf, and because they require careful supervision and self-control, they tax the Rider's strength.
The more choices the Rider is offered, the more exhausted the Rider gets.
In one study, shoppers who saw only 6 jams on display are 10 times more likely to buy a jar ofjam.
Change brings new choices that create uncertainty.
-and found that 62 percent of them were negative versus 38 percent positive.
Ambiguity is exhausting to the Rider because the Rider is tugging on the reins of the Elephant, trying to direct the Elephant down a new path. But when the road is uncertain, the Elephant will insist on taking the default path, the most familiar path, just as the doctors did. Why? Because uncertainty makes the Elephant anxious.
Any successful change requires a translation of ambiguous goals into concrete behaviors. In short, to make a switch, you need to script the critical moves.
To spark movement in a new direction, you need to provide crystal-clear guidance
You can't script -that would be like trying to foresee the seventeenth move in achess
When you want eto beha way, explain the "new way" clearly. Don't assur
If you are leading a change effort, you need to remove the ambiguity from your vision of change.
Until you can ladder your way down from a change idea to a specific hehavior, you're not ready to lead a switch.
To create movement, you've got to be specific and be concrete.

  <h3>Chapter 4: Point to the Destination</h3>
  <p>When you describe a compelling destination, you're helping to correct one of the Rider's great weaknesses-the tendency to get lost in analysis.
In looking for a goal that reaches the Elephant-that hits people in the gut-you can't bank on SMART goals
Destination postcards-pictures of a future that hard work can make possible-show the Rider where you're headed, and they show the Elephant why the journey is worthwhile.
If you're worried about the possibility of rationalization at home or at work, you need to squeeze out the ambiguity from your goal.
Marry your long-term goal with short-term critical moves.
Back up your destination postcard with a good behavioral script.
The Rider's strengths are substantial, and his flaws can be mitigated. When you appeal to the Rider inside yourself or inside others you are trying to influence, your game plan should be simple. First, follow the bright spots. As you analyze your situation, you're sure to find some things that are working better than others don't obsess
about the failures. Instead, investigate and clone the successes. Next, give direction to the Rider-both a start and a finish. Send him a destination postcard and script his critical moves.
When you do these things, you'll prepare the Rider to lead a switch. And you'llarm him for the ongoing struggles with his reluctant and formidable partner, the Elephant.</p>

  <h3>Chapter 5: Find the Feeling
</h3>
  <p>In one study, John Kotter and Dan Cohen observed that, in almost all successful change efforts, the sequence of change is not ANALYZE-THINK-CHANGE, but rather SEE-FEEL-CHANGE
The positive illusion is our tendency to believe we're better than average.
If you need quick and specific action, then negative emotions might help.
To solve bigger, more ambiguous problems, we need to encourage open minds, creativity, and hope.</p>

<div className ='sixth_part'>
  <h3>Chapter 6: Shrink the Change
</h3>
  <p>One way to motivate action is to make people feel as though they're already closer to the finish line than they might have thought.
If you want a reluctant Elephant to get moving, you need to shrink the change
Another way to shrink change is to think of small wins-milestones that are within reach.
When you engineer early successes, what you're really doing is engineering hope. Hope is precious to a change effort. It's Elephant fuel.
Once people are on the path and making progress, it's important to make their advances visible.
Solution-focused therapists devised a way of quantifying progress toward the miracle mentioned in Chapter 2. They create a miracle scale ranging from 0 to 10, where 10 is the miracle.
The advantage of scaling the miracle is that it demystifies the journey.
The value of the miracle that it focuses attention on smallsteps
When yo visible
I milestones that are attainable and visible rather than on the eventual destination, which may seem very remote.
achieve them, they start to get it into their heads that they can succeed.
Psychologist eick, i called "Small Wins: Redefining the Scale of Social Problems," said, "A small win reduces importance ('this is no big deal'), reduces demands ('that's all that needs to be done'), and raises perceived skill levels ('I can do at least that')."
You want to select small wins that have two traits: (1) They're meaningful. (2) They're "within immediate reach."
